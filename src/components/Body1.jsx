                  <p>It is our pleasure to welcome you and your family to the beautiful Monterey Peninsula. 
                  The Stage Coach Lodge offers easy access to the various tourist attractions located in and around 
                  the Peninsula with newly remodeled air-conditioned hotel rooms. Simply make a right turn onto Tenth 
                  Street when exiting the Downtown Monterey exit off of Highway 1 and you’ll find our hotel nestled in a 
                  quiet residential neighborhood within a short stroll to Lake El Estero, Dennis the Menace Park, a variety 
                  of shops and restaurants, and of course, the beach. Our Monterey hotel is also within walking distance 
                  to the Naval Postgraduate School and Hyatt Regency Conference Center. You can drive to downtown, 
                  Fisherman’s Wharf, Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium or hop back onto HWY 1 to get to Laguna 
                  Seca Raceway, the Monterey Fairgrounds, Carmel and the 17 Mile Drive, which are all within minutes 
                  of our property.</p>
